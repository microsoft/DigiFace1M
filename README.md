# DigiFace-1M Dataset

The DigiFace-1M dataset is a collection of over one million diverse synthetic face images for face recognition.
It was introduced in our paper [DigiFace-1M: 1 Million Digital Face Images for Face Recognition](https://microsoft.github.com/DigiFace1M).

The dataset contains:

- 720K images with 10K identities (72 images per identity). For each identity, 4 different sets of accessories are sampled and 18 images are rendered for each set.
- 500K images with 100K identities (5 images per identity). For each identity, only one set of accessories is sampled.

## Disclaimer

Some of our rendered faces may be close in appearance to the faces of real people.
Any such similarity is naturally unintentional, as it would be in a dataset of real images, where people may appear similar to others unknown to them.
