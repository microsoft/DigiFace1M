# DigiFace-1M Dataset

The DigiFace-1M dataset is a collection of over one million diverse synthetic face images for face recognition.

It was introduced in our paper [DigiFace-1M: 1 Million Digital Face Images for Face Recognition](https://microsoft.github.com/DigiFace1M) and can be used to train deep learning models for facial recognition.

The dataset contains:

- 720K images with 10K identities (72 images per identity). For each identity, 4 different sets of accessories are sampled and 18 images are rendered for each set.
- 500K images with 100K identities (5 images per identity). For each identity, only one set of accessories is sampled.

The DigiFace-1M dataset can be used for **non-commercial** research, and is licensed under the license found in [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Downloading The Dataset

For convenience the dataset is split into 8 parts which can be downloaded here: 72 images per identity [P1](https://facesyntheticspubwedata.blob.core.windows.net/wacv-2023/subjects_0-1999_72_imgs.zip), [P2](https://facesyntheticspubwedata.blob.core.windows.net/wacv-2023/subjects_2000-3999_72_imgs.zip), [P3](https://facesyntheticspubwedata.blob.core.windows.net/wacv-2023/subjects_4000-5999_72_imgs.zip), [P4](https://facesyntheticspubwedata.blob.core.windows.net/wacv-2023/subjects_6000-7999_72_imgs.zip), [P5](https://facesyntheticspubwedata.blob.core.windows.net/wacv-2023/subjects_8000-9999_72_imgs.zip); 5 images per identity , [P1](https://facesyntheticspubwedata.blob.core.windows.net/wacv-2023/subjects_100000-133332_5_imgs.zip), [P2](https://facesyntheticspubwedata.blob.core.windows.net/wacv-2023/subjects_133333-166665_5_imgs.zip), [P3](https://facesyntheticspubwedata.blob.core.windows.net/wacv-2023/subjects_166666-199998_5_imgs.zip)

## Dataset Layout

The DigiFace-1M Dataset contains cropped color images in the following layout.

```
subj_id_n
├── 0.png                 # First rendered image of subject subj_id_n
├── 1.png                 # Second rendered image of subject subj_id_n
...
├── k.png                 # k+1 rendered image of subject subj_id_n
```

## Disclaimer

Some of our rendered faces may be close in appearance to the faces of real people.
Any such similarity is naturally unintentional, as it would be in a dataset of real images, where people may appear similar to others unknown to them.
